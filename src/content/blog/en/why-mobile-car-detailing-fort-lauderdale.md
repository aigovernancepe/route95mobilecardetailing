If you live in Fort Lauderdale, you already know what the South Florida environment does to your car. The sun beats down relentlessly, fading paint and cracking dashboards. Salt air from the Atlantic corrodes chrome and trim. And humidity creates the perfect conditions for mold and mildew inside your cabin.

Most people deal with this by running through an automated car wash once a week. But those spinning brushes and recycled water actually cause more harm than good — swirl marks, scratches, and a "clean" that barely lasts two days.

## What Makes Mobile Detailing Different

Mobile car detailing brings a professional detailer directly to your location with all the equipment, water, and products needed to properly clean and protect your vehicle. Here's why it's a better approach:

### You Don't Waste Your Saturday

Instead of driving to a detail shop, waiting in line, and sitting in a lobby for hours, a mobile detailer comes to your home or office. You can work, relax, or handle errands while your car gets the attention it deserves.

### Better Products, Better Results

At Route95, we use professional-grade products from Chemical Guys, Koch-Chemie, and 3D. These aren't the diluted soaps and harsh chemicals used at drive-through washes. They're formulated to clean effectively while protecting your paint, leather, and trim.

### One-on-One Attention

Your car doesn't share a bay with dozens of other vehicles. Our detailer focuses entirely on your vehicle from start to finish. Every panel, every crevice, every surface gets proper attention.

### Protection Against Florida Conditions

A proper detail doesn't just clean your car — it protects it. Wax and sealant guard against UV damage. Leather conditioning prevents cracking from heat. Interior treatments fight mold and mildew growth.

## The Fort Lauderdale Factor

Living in Fort Lauderdale means your car faces unique challenges that generic car washes don't address:

- **UV Exposure**: Our intense sunlight degrades paint, rubber, and plastic faster than almost anywhere in the country.
- **Salt Air**: Even if you never drive on the beach, salt air reaches everywhere in Broward County.
- **Hard Water**: Florida's mineral-rich water leaves spots and deposits that regular washing can make worse.
- **Pollen and Tree Sap**: Our tropical vegetation means constant exposure to organic contaminants.

A mobile detailer who works in Fort Lauderdale every day understands these conditions and uses products and techniques specifically suited to them.

## Is Mobile Detailing Worth It?

If you value your time and your vehicle, absolutely. A quality mobile detail protects your car's finish, preserves its resale value, and keeps your interior healthy — all without you having to go anywhere.
