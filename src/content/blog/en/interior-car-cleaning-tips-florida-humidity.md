  - question: "How Do You Prevent Mold in Your Car in Florida?"
    answer: "Prevent mold in your Florida car by keeping windows cracked slightly when parked, using moisture-absorbing products, cleaning spills immediately, running the AC on recirculate for 5 minutes before turning off the car, and getting professional interior detailing every 3-4 months."
  - question: "Why Do Florida Cars Get Musty Odors?"
    answer: "Florida cars develop musty odors because the average 75% humidity traps moisture in carpets, seat foam, and ventilation systems. Inside a closed car in the sun, these conditions create a greenhouse effect where mold and mildew thrive, producing persistent odors."
  - question: "How Often Should You Clean Your Car Interior in Humid Climates?"
    answer: "In humid climates like South Florida, you should vacuum and wipe down your car interior every 2 weeks and get a professional interior detail every 3-4 months. This schedule prevents mold growth, eliminates trapped moisture, and keeps upholstery from deteriorating."

Florida humidity doesn't just make you uncomfortable — it does real damage inside your car. Moisture gets trapped in carpets, under seats, and inside ventilation systems. Left unchecked, it leads to mold growth, musty odors, and deteriorating upholstery.

If you've ever noticed a stale smell when you open your car door in the morning, humidity is likely the cause. Here's how to fight back.

## Why Florida Interiors Need Extra Attention

The average relative humidity in Fort Lauderdale hovers around 75%. Inside a closed car sitting in the sun, conditions become a greenhouse — hot and damp. This is the exact environment where mold and mildew thrive.

Common problems include:

- **Musty or mildew smell** that air fresheners only mask
- **Mold growth** under floor mats and in seat crevices
- **Foggy windows** from interior moisture
- **Sticky surfaces** on dashboards and consoles
- **Leather cracking** from heat and humidity cycles

## Keeping Your Interior Dry

### Don't Leave Windows Cracked

Many people crack their windows to "let the car breathe." In Florida, this actually invites humidity inside. Keep windows sealed when parked. If your car has a cabin air recirculation mode, use it to reduce the amount of humid outside air entering the system.

### Use Your AC Before Turning Off

Run your air conditioning on recirculate mode for the last few minutes of every drive. This helps dry out the evaporator and reduces the moisture available for mold growth in your ventilation system.

### Check Your Cabin Air Filter

A clogged cabin air filter restricts airflow and can trap moisture. Replace it every 15,000 to 20,000 miles — or more frequently in Florida's pollen-heavy environment. A fresh filter also improves air quality and AC performance.

### Floor Mats Matter

Rubber or all-weather floor mats are essential in Florida. They prevent moisture from soaking into your carpet. Remove and dry them regularly — water collects underneath and promotes mold growth without you realizing it.

## Deep Cleaning Your Interior

### Carpet and Seat Shampooing

Even with regular vacuuming, Florida car carpets accumulate moisture and organic material that regular cleaning can't reach. A hot water extraction (steam cleaning) process pulls deep-seated dirt and moisture out of carpet fibers and upholstery.

At Route95, we use [Chemical Guys](https://www.chemicalguys.com/) Foaming Citrus Fabric Clean and professional extractors that inject cleaning solution deep into the fabric and then vacuum it out along with the dirt.

### Leather Care in Humidity

Leather seats in Florida face a double threat: UV damage from the sun and moisture damage from humidity. Leather is a natural material that absorbs and releases moisture. In Florida's humid climate, this constant cycling can cause cracking and discoloration.

Clean leather with a pH-balanced leather cleaner — never household cleaners or baby wipes, which can strip the finish. Follow with a quality leather conditioner that contains UV protection. [Koch-Chemie](https://www.koch-chemie.com/) and [Chemical Guys](https://www.chemicalguys.com/) both make excellent options we use daily.

### Dashboard and Console Cleaning

Plastic and vinyl surfaces get sticky in humidity as plasticizers break down. Use a dedicated interior cleaner from brands like [Meguiar's](https://www.meguiars.com/) or [3D Products](https://www.3dproducts.com/), not household products like Armor All that leave greasy residues that attract more dust.

A clean, lightly dressed dashboard not only looks better but resists the sticky buildup that Florida humidity causes.

## Odor Elimination

If your car already smells musty, air fresheners won't solve the problem. They just cover it up while mold continues to grow.

Proper odor elimination requires:

1. **Finding the source**: Usually under floor mats, in seat rails, or in the ventilation system
2. **Deep cleaning**: Shampooing carpets and seats to remove mold and bacteria
3. **Ozone treatment or enzyme cleaner**: These break down odor-causing molecules rather than masking them
4. **Prevention**: Addressing the moisture source so the smell doesn't return

## A Realistic Interior Maintenance Schedule

For Fort Lauderdale car owners, here's what we recommend:

- **Weekly**: Wipe down hard surfaces, check under floor mats for moisture
- **Monthly**: Thorough vacuum including under seats and in crevices
- **Every 3 months**: Leather cleaning and conditioning
- **Every 6 months**: Full interior detail with carpet and seat shampooing
