          Smoke odor is one of the hardest smells to remove from a vehicle. Smoke particles are tiny and penetrate everything—seats, carpets, headliner, door panels, vents, and even hard plastic surfaces. Air fresheners can't touch it. You need a systematic approach that treats every surface where smoke has settled.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our smoke odor removal service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From the Landings to Wilton Manors, we come to you with the equipment and expertise to eliminate smoke smell completely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Getting smoke smell out matters for resale value. Florida has one of the largest used car markets in the country, and non-smoking vehicles sell faster and for more money.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Smoke Odor Removal Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke odor removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $200 to $400 depending on how heavily the car was smoked in.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A car with light smoke exposure—occasional smoking over a few months—falls on the lower end. Vehicles smoked in daily for years need more intensive treatment with multiple ozone sessions. The headliner often holds the most smoke residue and may need special attention.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We'll assess your situation and give you an honest estimate of what it will take.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Smoke Odor Removal Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke odor removal takes 3 to 4 hours for a full treatment, sometimes longer for heavy smoke damage.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This is not a quick service. Properly removing smoke smell requires cleaning every surface, running ozone treatment, and sometimes repeating the process. Rushing leads to the smell coming back, so we take the time to do it right.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Your car needs to air out for 20-30 minutes after ozone treatment before driving.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Is Smoke Smell So Hard to Remove?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke particles are microscopic and coat every surface in your car. The smell hides in fabric fibers, foam padding, ventilation ducts, and porous materials throughout the cabin.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">When someone smokes in a car, several things happen:</p>
        <div class="space-y-3 mb-4">
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Fabric absorption</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Seats, carpets, and headliner absorb smoke deep into their fibers. The smell releases slowly over time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Surface coating</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">A thin film of tar and nicotine coats hard surfaces like the dashboard, windows, and trim.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Vent contamination</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Smoke circulates through your AC system and coats the evaporator and ducts. Every time you run the AC, it blows that smell back out.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Foam penetration</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Seat cushions and padding absorb smoke that regular cleaning can't reach.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This is why air fresheners fail. They add a scent on top of the smoke smell, but the smoke particles are still there, continuously releasing odor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs you need professional smoke odor removal:</p>
