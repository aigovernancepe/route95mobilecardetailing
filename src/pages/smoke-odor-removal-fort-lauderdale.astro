          Smoke odor is one of the hardest smells to remove from a vehicle. Smoke particles are tiny and penetrate everything—seats, carpets, headliner, door panels, vents, and even hard plastic surfaces. Air fresheners can't touch it. You need a systematic approach that treats every surface where smoke has settled.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our car smoke odor removal service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, and surrounding Broward County areas. From the Landings to Wilton Manors to Pompano's beach side, we come to you with the equipment and expertise to eliminate smoke smell completely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Getting smoke smell out matters for resale value. Florida has one of the largest used car markets in the country, and non-smoking vehicles sell faster and for more money. Removing smoke odor can increase your car's value by $500 to $2,000 or more.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke odor removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $200 to $400 depending on how heavily the car was smoked in.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A car with light smoke exposure—occasional smoking over a few months—falls on the lower end. Vehicles smoked in daily for years need more intensive treatment with multiple ozone sessions. The headliner often holds the most smoke residue and may need special attention.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We'll assess your situation and give you an honest estimate of what it will take. Our pricing is the same whether you're in Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, or anywhere in Broward County.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke odor removal takes 3 to 4 hours for a full treatment, sometimes longer for heavy smoke damage.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This is not a quick service. Properly removing smoke smell requires cleaning every surface, running ozone treatment, and sometimes repeating the process. Rushing leads to the smell coming back, so we take the time to do it right.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Your car needs to air out for 20-30 minutes after ozone treatment before driving.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Is Ozone Treatment for Smoke Removal?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Ozone treatment is the most effective method for eliminating smoke odor from cars. An ozone generator produces O3 molecules that bond with and neutralize smoke particles at a molecular level.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Unlike air fresheners that mask odors, ozone treatment actually destroys the odor-causing compounds. We seal your vehicle and run the generator for 1-2 hours, allowing ozone to reach every surface including inside vents, under seats, and deep within upholstery padding.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          After treatment, the ozone naturally breaks down back to regular oxygen (O2) within 30 minutes. The result is a genuinely odor-free interior—not a scented cover-up.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Smoke particles are microscopic and coat every surface in your car. The smell hides in fabric fibers, foam padding, ventilation ducts, and porous materials throughout the cabin.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">When someone smokes in a car, several things happen:</p>
        <div class="space-y-3 mb-4">
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Fabric absorption</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Seats, carpets, and headliner absorb smoke deep into their fibers. The smell releases slowly over time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Surface coating</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">A thin film of tar and nicotine coats hard surfaces like the dashboard, windows, and trim.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Vent contamination</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Smoke circulates through your AC system and coats the evaporator and ducts. Every time you run the AC, it blows that smell back out.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-1">Foam penetration</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Seat cushions and padding absorb smoke that regular cleaning can't reach.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This is why air fresheners fail. They add a scent on top of the smoke smell, but the smoke particles are still there, continuously releasing odor.
        </p>
