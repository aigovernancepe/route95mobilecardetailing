          Fort Lauderdale's water is notoriously hard—loaded with calcium, magnesium, and other minerals. When water evaporates from your car's surface, these minerals remain behind as white, chalky spots. Sprinkler overspray, rain, and even improper drying after washing leave mineral deposits that bond to paint and glass.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Fresh water spots wash off easily. But in Florida's heat, spots bake into the clear coat within hours. Once minerals etch into the surface, regular washing won't remove them. Many people mistake etched water spots for permanent paint damage—but with the right techniques, they can be removed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We use Chemical Guys water spot remover and specialized compounds to safely dissolve mineral deposits without damaging your paint. Our mobile service brings professional water spot removal directly to your Fort Lauderdale location.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Water Spot Removal Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Professional water spot removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $75 to $150 depending on severity and coverage area.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Light spotting on a few panels falls at the lower end. Heavy mineral etching covering the entire vehicle, or spots that have been baked in for weeks, requires extensive treatment and polishing. Glass water spot removal may be additional.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Water Spot Removal Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Water spot removal takes 1 to 2 hours depending on severity and how many panels are affected.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Each affected area needs chemical treatment, dwell time, and often polishing to fully remove etching. Severe cases may require multiple stages of treatment. We take the time needed to fully correct the damage without shortcuts.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Water Spot Removal Matters in South Florida</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fort Lauderdale's hard water and intense sun create perfect conditions for permanent water spot etching within hours of exposure.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Common causes of water spots in Fort Lauderdale:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Sprinkler systems hitting parked cars—extremely common in HOA communities</li>
          <li>Afternoon rain showers followed by intense sun</li>
          <li>Hard water at home car washes and self-service bays</li>
          <li>Pool water splashing from nearby pools</li>
          <li>Air conditioning condensation dripping onto paint</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          The longer water spots remain, the deeper they etch. What starts as a surface deposit becomes permanent clear coat damage. Early treatment saves time, money, and your paint.
