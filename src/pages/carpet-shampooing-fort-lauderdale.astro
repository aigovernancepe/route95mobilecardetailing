          Your car's carpets catch everything that comes in on your shoes. In Fort Lauderdale, that means beach sand, mud from afternoon rain showers, and dirt from parking lots. Over time, this debris works deep into the carpet fibers where vacuuming can't reach it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our carpet shampooing service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From the waterfront homes in Nurmi Isles to condos near downtown, we come to you with all our equipment and water. No need to drop your car off anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Professional carpet cleaning does more than make your floors look better. It removes the trapped moisture and organic matter that can lead to mold growth in Florida's humid climate.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Car Carpet Shampooing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Car carpet shampooing in Fort Lauderdale costs $40 to $80 depending on your vehicle size and carpet condition.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Compact cars and sedans with light soiling fall on the lower end. SUVs, trucks, and minivans have more floor space and cost more to clean. Heavy staining from mud, spills, or years of neglect may need multiple passes and pre-treatment, which adds to the price.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Carpet Shampooing Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Carpet shampooing takes 30 to 45 minutes for most vehicles, plus 2-4 hours of drying time afterward.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We remove your floor mats and clean them separately. The main carpet gets shampooed in sections so we don't oversaturate any area. We spend extra time on extraction because pulling out moisture is the key to preventing mildew in Florida's humidity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Leaving windows cracked after we finish helps carpets dry faster, especially on humid days.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Do Your Car Carpets Need Shampooing?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Car carpets trap sand, dirt, and moisture that vacuuming alone cannot remove. Shampooing extracts contaminants from deep in the fibers.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Beach sand is the number one carpet problem we see in Fort Lauderdale vehicles. Sand particles are sharp and work their way deep into carpet fibers. Each time you step on the carpet, those particles grind against the fibers and cause wear. Professional extraction pulls out what vacuuming leaves behind.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Florida's humidity makes carpet care even more important. Moisture from wet shoes, spilled drinks, or rain getting in creates perfect conditions for mold and mildew. That musty smell many cars develop comes from organic matter breaking down in damp carpet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs your carpets need shampooing:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li>Visible stains from drinks, food, or mud</li>
          <li>Gritty feeling even after vacuuming</li>
          <li>Musty or sour smell in your car</li>
          <li>Discoloration or dark patches</li>
          <li>Allergies act up when driving</li>
