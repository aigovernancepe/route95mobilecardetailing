          <strong>Clay bar treatment removes bonded surface contaminants that regular washing cannot touch, including industrial fallout, tree sap, overspray, and rail dust.

        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In South Florida, airborne contaminants bond to your paint quickly due to heat and humidity. We recommend clay bar treatment every 6 months or before any wax or sealant application for best results.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Does Tire Dressing Do for Your Vehicle?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Tire dressing restores the deep black appearance of your sidewalls while protecting rubber from UV-induced cracking and dry rot. We use water-based dressings that provide a natural satin finish without slinging onto your paint when you drive.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Florida's intense sun dries out tire rubber faster than northern climates. Regular tire dressing extends sidewall life and makes your entire vehicle look freshly detailed.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>In South Florida, bug and tar removal is essential during love bug seasons in May and September when acidic bug residue can etch through clear coat within 24 hours. We safely dissolve splatter and road tar without damaging your paint or existing wax protection.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Don't let bug residue sit on your paint. The longer it stays, the deeper the damage. Our specialized bug and tar solvent breaks down organic acids without affecting your paint or wax layer.

      <!-- Water Spot Removal -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Causes Water Spots and How Are They Removed?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Water spots form when mineral-rich water from sprinklers, hard water, or rain evaporates and leaves calcium and magnesium deposits on your paint. Left untreated, these minerals etch into the clear coat and require professional correction to remove safely.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          South Florida's hard water and frequent irrigation make water spotting especially common. We remove existing spots and can apply hydrophobic protection to prevent future spotting on vehicles parked near irrigation systems.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Black plastic trim fades to chalky gray under Florida's relentless sun as UV radiation breaks down the plastic's surface. Professional trim restoration brings faded pieces back to deep black and applies UV-blocking protectant to slow future deterioration by months.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Trim restoration is one of the fastest ways to make an older vehicle look years newer. We treat door handles, mirror caps, window surrounds, and bumper trim with professional-grade restorer and protectant.
