          Your home vacuum can't do what our equipment does. We use commercial extractors with specialized attachments designed for automotive interiors. These tools reach into seat tracks, between cushions, under seats, and into all the tight spaces where dirt hides.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our interior vacuuming service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From downtown high-rises to homes near Hugh Taylor Birch State Park, we come to you ready to get the job done right.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Beach sand is the number one carpet problem we see in Fort Lauderdale vehicles. Sand particles work deep into fibers and seat crevices where regular vacuums can't reach. Professional extraction makes a real difference.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Interior vacuuming in Fort Lauderdale costs $25 to $40 depending on your vehicle size and condition.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Compact cars and sedans fall on the lower end. Larger vehicles like SUVs, trucks, and minivans with more floor space and seating cost more. Vehicles with heavy sand or debris buildup may need extra time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Interior vacuuming pairs well with other services like seat shampooing or leather care. Ask about bundled pricing when you call.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Interior vacuuming takes 20 to 30 minutes for most vehicles, depending on size and how much debris we're removing.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We don't rush through like a drive-through car wash. Every seat gets moved to reach the carpet underneath. Every crevice gets attention. Floor mats come out and get cleaned separately so we can access the carpet below.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Do You Need Professional Interior Vacuuming?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Consumer vacuums lack the suction power and specialized attachments needed to remove debris from automotive interiors.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Car interiors have dozens of places where dirt collects:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Between seat cushions and bolsters</li>
          <li>In seat track rails where seats slide</li>
          <li>Under seats in the carpet</li>
          <li>Inside door pockets and storage compartments</li>
          <li>Around pedals and footwells</li>
          <li>In cup holders and console areas</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Your home vacuum might get the visible stuff, but the sand and dirt hiding in these spots stays behind. That debris keeps grinding against surfaces every time you move around, wearing out carpets and upholstery faster.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In Fort Lauderdale, sand is the biggest issue. A single beach trip can deposit sand into every corner of your interior. Those particles are sharp and abrasive. Left in place, they damage carpet fibers and scratch plastic trim.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs you need professional vacuuming:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li>Gritty feeling when you run your hand on carpets</li>
          <li>Visible debris in seat crevices</li>
          <li>Sand or dirt falling out when you move seats</li>
          <li>Crumbs and debris in cup holders and pockets</li>
          <li>Musty smell from trapped organic matter</li>
