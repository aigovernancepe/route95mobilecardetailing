          Leather is skin, and skin needs moisture. Every day your car sits in Fort Lauderdale's intense sun, UV rays pull moisture from your leather seats. Without regular conditioning, leather becomes dry, stiff, and eventually cracks. Once cracking starts, there's no fixing it—only replacement.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our leather conditioning service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From Las Olas Isles to Coral Ridge, we come to you with professional products that penetrate deep into leather pores.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          In our experience, leather in Fort Lauderdale vehicles needs conditioning every 2-3 months due to the intense UV exposure through windows. Northern climates can go longer between treatments, but not here.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Leather Conditioning Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Leather conditioning in Fort Lauderdale costs $40 to $75 depending on your vehicle size and leather condition.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A sedan with well-maintained leather falls on the lower end. Larger vehicles with more leather surface area cost more. Severely dried-out leather may need multiple coats to fully restore moisture, which takes more product and time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Most clients pair leather conditioning with cleaning for complete care. Clean leather absorbs conditioner much better than dirty leather.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Leather Conditioning Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Leather conditioning takes about 20 minutes for most vehicles, with the product absorbing fully within an hour.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We apply conditioner to all leather surfaces including seats, door panels, armrests, and center console. Each area gets worked in thoroughly so the product penetrates rather than sitting on top.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Your car is ready to drive immediately. The conditioner continues absorbing as you go about your day.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Does Your Leather Need Conditioning?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Florida's intense sun dries out leather faster than anywhere else. Conditioning replaces lost moisture and creates a barrier against UV damage.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Think of leather conditioning like moisturizing your own skin. When skin dries out, it gets tight, flaky, and eventually cracks. Leather does the same thing. The difference is you can't heal cracked leather—you can only replace it, which costs thousands of dollars.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We typically apply 2-3 coats of conditioner on Fort Lauderdale vehicles because the sun depletes moisture faster than in northern climates. That extra attention makes a real difference in how long your leather lasts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs your leather needs conditioning:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Leather feels stiff or tight</li>
          <li>Surface looks dull rather than soft sheen</li>
          <li>Fine lines appearing on seat bolsters</li>
          <li>Cracking starting at seams or stress points</li>
          <li>Leather is more than 3 months since last treatment</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          The driver's seat and left door panel show wear first because they get the most sun exposure and body contact. If those areas look dry, it's time for conditioning.

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          For best results, we recommend leather conditioning every 2-3 months in Fort Lauderdale. Regular maintenance costs far less than replacing cracked leather seats.
