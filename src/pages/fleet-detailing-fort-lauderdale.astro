Our fleet detailing programs are designed for businesses that understand the value of consistent vehicle maintenance without the operational disruption of traditional detail shops.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Fleet Detailing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fleet detailing in Fort Lauderdale starts at $75 per vehicle with volume discounts for fleets of 5+ vehicles. Pricing depends on vehicle type, service level, and fleet size. We offer custom maintenance plans for businesses that need regular scheduled service.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Compact cars and sedans fall at the lower end of the range. Vans, trucks, and SUVs cost more due to additional surface area and time required. We provide a detailed quote after evaluating your specific fleet and service needs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Businesses that commit to recurring service receive the best rates. Regular maintenance also reduces the cost per visit because vehicles stay cleaner between appointments, requiring less intensive work each time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Types of Fleets Do You Service?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>We service all types of commercial and business fleets in Broward County. No fleet is too small or too large. From a handful of company cars to a full dealership lot, we have the equipment and team to handle it.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Delivery vans and box trucks</li>
          <li>Company cars and executive vehicles</li>
          <li>Rental car fleets</li>
          <li>Dealership inventory and trade-ins</li>
          <li>Rideshare vehicles (Uber, Lyft)</li>
          <li>Real estate agents' cars</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Each fleet type has unique needs. Delivery vans accumulate road grime quickly and need frequent exterior washes. Rideshare vehicles require interior sanitization between passengers. Dealership inventory needs showroom-ready detailing. We tailor our service to match your specific requirements.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Does Mobile Fleet Detailing Save Your Business Money?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Mobile fleet detailing eliminates downtime because we come directly to your lot with all necessary equipment. Your employees stay on the job, your vehicles stay on-site, and bulk pricing on multiple vehicles keeps costs lower than individual detail shop visits.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Consider the hidden costs of sending vehicles to a shop: employee time driving each vehicle there and back, vehicles out of service during the appointment, and paying full retail price per vehicle. With our mobile service, we handle everything in your parking lot while your team works.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Professional appearance also drives revenue. Clean, well-maintained vehicles build customer trust and confidence. A spotless delivery van or company car sends the message that your business pays attention to detail and takes pride in its work.
