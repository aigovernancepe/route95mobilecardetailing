          Route95 provides mobile leather cleaning throughout Fort Lauderdale. We bring professional equipment and pH-balanced Chemical Guys leather cleaner directly to your home or office. Your leather surfaces get thoroughly cleaned without harsh chemicals that damage the material.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Living in South Florida means your leather takes extra abuse. Sunscreen transfers from your skin every time you sit down. Sweat and body oils soak into the leather daily. The Florida sun bakes these contaminants deeper into the material. Without proper cleaning, your leather ages years faster than it should.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We serve luxury vehicle owners throughout Las Olas, Nurmi Isles, Seven Isles, and all of Fort Lauderdale who understand that premium interiors require premium care.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mb-4">How Much Does Leather Cleaning Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Professional leather cleaning in Fort Lauderdale typically costs between $50 and $100 depending on how many leather surfaces your vehicle has.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Vehicles with leather seats only cost less than those with full leather interiors including door panels, center console, and dashboard. We assess your specific vehicle and provide exact pricing before starting any work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Many luxury car owners combine leather cleaning with leather conditioning for complete leather care. This package pricing offers better value than booking services separately.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mb-4">How Long Does Leather Cleaning Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Leather cleaning takes approximately 30 minutes for most vehicles with standard leather seating areas.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Full leather interiors with door panels, armrests, and console trim take longer—usually 45 minutes to an hour. We don't rush through the process because missed areas continue deteriorating even when the rest looks clean. Since we come to your location, you can continue your day while we work.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mb-4">Why Does Leather Need Professional Cleaning?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Leather absorbs oils and contaminants that home cleaning products cannot safely remove without risking damage to the material.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Every time you drive, your body transfers oils and products to your leather seats. Sunscreen is especially damaging. Lotions, hand creams, and natural skin oils all accumulate on leather surfaces. In Fort Lauderdale's climate, you're applying sunscreen almost daily—and much of it ends up on your seats.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          These contaminants don't just sit on the surface. They penetrate into the leather, breaking down the protective finish and eventually the leather itself. You'll notice the driver's seat showing wear long before passenger seats because that's where oils concentrate most.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Professional cleaning uses pH-balanced products designed specifically for automotive leather. We lift these embedded contaminants safely without stripping the leather's natural properties or factory finish.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1e3a5f] mb-4">Should I Condition Leather After Cleaning?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Leather conditioning after cleaning restores moisture and creates protection against future damage from Florida sun and humidity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Cleaning removes oils—both the bad ones from your skin and the good ones that keep leather supple. Conditioning replaces that moisture and adds a protective barrier. We strongly recommend combining leather cleaning with leather conditioning, especially for vehicles driven daily in Fort Lauderdale. The Florida sun dries out leather faster than almost anywhere else in the country.
