          Most people never think about what's under the hood until something goes wrong. Grease, road grime, dirt, and leaked fluids accumulate over months and years. That buildup traps heat, hides leaks, and makes your engine bay look neglected when you pop the hood for any reason.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In Fort Lauderdale, the combination of heat and humidity accelerates grime buildup. Salt air from the ocean corrodes exposed metal surfaces faster than in drier climates. A clean engine bay runs cooler, lasts longer, and gives you peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Route95 brings professional engine bay cleaning directly to your Fort Lauderdale location. We use automotive-specific degreasers and low-pressure rinsing to safely clean your engine bay without damaging sensitive electrical components.

          <strong>Engine bay cleaning in Fort Lauderdale costs $75 to $150 depending on engine size and level of buildup.</strong>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          A regularly maintained engine bay with light dust falls at the lower end. Engines with heavy grease buildup, leaked fluids, or years of neglect require more product and labor. We quote based on your vehicle's condition.

          <strong>Engine bay cleaning takes about 45 minutes including degreasing, rinsing, and dressing.</strong>

          Heavily soiled engines may take up to an hour. The degreaser needs dwell time to break down baked-on grease and grime before rinsing. We allow proper time for each step to get the best results safely.
