          Fabric seats and carpets absorb everything. Coffee, soda, water, and anything else you spill soaks straight into the fibers and causes stains. Fabric protection changes that. Liquids sit on top of the surface, giving you time to wipe them up before they become permanent.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our fabric protection service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From condos near the Intracoastal to homes in Plantation, we come to you with professional ceramic fabric coating.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          In Fort Lauderdale, fabric protection makes even more sense. Between beach trips, afternoon rain, and drinks in the car, your fabric takes on moisture constantly.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fabric protection in Fort Lauderdale costs $50 to $100 depending on your vehicle size and how much fabric needs coating.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Sedans with front seats and basic carpet fall on the lower end. SUVs and minivans with third-row seating, more carpet area, and fabric door panels cost more. We coat every fabric surface you want protected.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Most clients add fabric protection after seat or carpet shampooing. Clean fabric accepts the protection coating better and lasts longer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Fabric Protection Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fabric protection takes about 15 minutes to apply, with the coating fully cured within 24 hours.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Application is quick because the product goes on evenly with minimal effort. We spray the ceramic coating onto fabric surfaces and let it penetrate. Your car is ready to drive immediately—just avoid getting seats wet for a few hours while the coating cures.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Protection typically lasts 6-12 months depending on use and how often you clean your seats.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Unprotected fabric absorbs spills instantly, creating stains that are difficult or impossible to fully remove. Protection gives you a second chance.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Think about what happens in your car:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Coffee splashes when you hit a bump</li>
          <li>Kids drop drinks and snacks</li>
          <li>Wet swimsuits and towels after beach trips</li>
          <li>Rain blowing in through open windows</li>
          <li>Sweat soaking into seats on hot days</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Without protection, each of these events potentially causes a permanent stain. With protection, liquids bead up on the surface. You see the spill, grab a napkin, wipe it up, and the fabric underneath stays clean.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We find that fabric-seated vehicles in Florida benefit from protection more than anywhere else. The combination of heat, humidity, and active outdoor lifestyle means more moisture exposure than cars in drier climates.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs you should consider fabric protection:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li>You've dealt with stains you couldn't fully remove</li>
          <li>Kids or pets regularly ride in your car</li>
          <li>You eat or drink in your vehicle</li>
          <li>Beach trips are part of your routine</li>
          <li>You want to maintain resale value</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Fabric protection works best when applied to freshly cleaned fabric. The coating bonds directly to clean fibers rather than sitting on top of dirt and oils.
