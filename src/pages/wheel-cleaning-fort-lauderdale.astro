          Your wheels and rims take more abuse than any other part of your car's exterior. Brake dust—a corrosive mixture of metal particles and adhesive—coats your rims every time you stop. Road grime, tar, and salt spray add to the buildup.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Automatic car washes barely touch your rims. Quick spray washes leave brake dust embedded in the finish. Over time, this contamination etches into rim surfaces and becomes permanent if not properly removed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We bring professional wheel and rim cleaning directly to your Fort Lauderdale location, using wheel-safe products that dissolve brake dust without damaging your rim finish—whether chrome, polished aluminum, painted, or alloy.

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Brake dust etches into rim clear coat and paint</li>
          <li>Corrosion starts under embedded contamination</li>

          <li>Rims look dirty even after washing</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          In Fort Lauderdale, road salt from coastal air accelerates rim corrosion. Regular professional rim cleaning prevents permanent damage that would require expensive refinishing or replacement.
