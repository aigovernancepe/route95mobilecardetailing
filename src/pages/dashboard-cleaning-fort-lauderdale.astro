          Your dashboard takes the worst sun exposure of any interior surface. In Fort Lauderdale, that means year-round UV bombardment that fades color, dries out vinyl, and eventually causes cracking. A dusty dashboard also looks neglected and can trigger allergies when your AC blows particles around the cabin.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our dashboard cleaning service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. Whether you live near the Boatyard neighborhood or out by Plantation, we come to you with professional products that clean and protect in one visit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Dashboard cleaning includes your entire front dash area—the main surface, instrument cluster, center console, vents, screens, and all the trim pieces that collect dust and fingerprints.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Dashboard cleaning in Fort Lauderdale costs $30 to $50 depending on your vehicle's interior complexity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Basic interiors with simple dash layouts fall on the lower end. Luxury vehicles with multiple screens, intricate trim pieces, and textured surfaces take more time and care, which affects pricing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Most clients add dashboard cleaning to other interior services like vacuuming or leather care. We can bundle services for better value.

        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We work through each section of your dashboard methodically. Vents need special attention because dust collects deep inside. Screens require gentle cleaning with products that won't leave residue or damage displays. Textured surfaces trap dust and need proper agitation to release it.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Florida sun damages unprotected dashboards faster than anywhere else. UV rays fade color, dry out materials, and cause cracking that ruins your interior.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Dashboards are made from vinyl, plastic, and rubber compounds that break down under UV exposure. Without protection, these materials:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Fade from black or gray to a chalky lighter color</li>
          <li>Become brittle and develop cracks</li>
          <li>Shrink slightly, causing gaps and squeaks</li>
          <li>Release chemicals that create that film on your windshield</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Beyond sun damage, a dirty dashboard affects your driving experience. Dust particles blow through your vents and into your lungs. Grime on screens makes them harder to read. Sticky residue on controls feels unpleasant every time you adjust something.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs your dashboard needs attention:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
          <li>Visible dust layer on surfaces</li>
          <li>Faded or grayish color on trim pieces</li>
          <li>Fingerprints and smudges on screens</li>
          <li>Sticky feeling on buttons and controls</li>
          <li>Film buildup on inside of windshield</li>
