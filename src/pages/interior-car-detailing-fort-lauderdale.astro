      <!-- What Is Interior Car Detailing -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Is Interior Car Detailing and What Does It Include?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Interior car detailing is a comprehensive deep cleaning of every surface inside your vehicle — from headliner to floor mats. It goes far beyond vacuuming and wiping. Professional interior detailing extracts embedded dirt from fabric, conditions and protects leather, sanitizes with steam, and eliminates odors at their source rather than masking them.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A full interior detail includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Seat shampooing or leather cleaning and conditioning</li>
          <li>Carpet and floor mat deep extraction</li>
          <li>Dashboard, console, and door panel cleaning</li>
          <li>Steam cleaning and sanitization</li>
          <li>Interior glass cleaning</li>
          <li>Air vent and crevice detailing</li>
          <li>Odor elimination treatment</li>
          <li>UV protectant application on all surfaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We follow <a href="https://www.the-ida.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#0f2a4a] font-semibold hover:text-[#c0c7cf]">IDA (International Detailing Association)</a> standards for interior care, using material-specific products and techniques that clean thoroughly without damaging surfaces.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Interior Car Detailing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Interior car detailing in Fort Lauderdale ranges from $75 to $250 depending on your vehicle size, interior condition, and the services included. A basic interior clean with vacuuming, wipe-down, and glass starts around $75. A full interior detail with shampooing, leather care, steam cleaning, and odor treatment runs $150-$250. Heavily neglected interiors or smoke odor removal may require additional treatment time.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Our mobile service includes no hidden fees — the price covers travel, equipment, water, and all products. We provide exact quotes before starting so you know the cost upfront. Call 754-215-2272 for a quick estimate based on your vehicle.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- How Long -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Interior Detailing Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Interior detailing takes 1 to 3 hours depending on your vehicle's size and condition. A standard sedan in good shape takes about 1-1.5 hours. SUVs and trucks need 1.5-2.5 hours. Vehicles with heavy staining, pet hair buildup, or embedded smoke odor may require 3 hours or more for proper extraction and treatment.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We don't rush interior work. Proper extraction requires dwell time for cleaning solutions to break down stains, and steam cleaning needs thorough coverage to sanitize every surface. You can go about your day while we work — we'll let you know when your vehicle is ready.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Florida Climate -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Is Interior Detailing Critical in Florida's Climate?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Florida's combination of extreme humidity, intense heat, and year-round UV exposure creates uniquely harsh conditions for vehicle interiors. Moisture trapped in carpets and seat fabric breeds mold, mildew, and bacteria within days. UV radiation cracks dashboards, fades leather, and degrades plastic trim faster than in any northern state.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Regular interior detailing in Fort Lauderdale isn't just cosmetic — it's protective. Steam cleaning kills mold spores before they spread. Leather conditioning prevents cracking caused by heat cycling between scorching sun and air conditioning. UV protectant on dashboards and trim blocks the radiation that causes fading and brittleness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We recommend interior detailing every 3-4 months in South Florida to stay ahead of humidity damage and keep your cabin fresh and protected.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Products -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">What Products Do Professional Interior Detailers Use?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Professional interior detailers use material-specific products from brands like <a href="https://www.chemicalguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#0f2a4a] font-semibold hover:text-[#c0c7cf]">Chemical Guys</a> and <a href="https://www.koch-chemie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#0f2a4a] font-semibold hover:text-[#c0c7cf]">Koch-Chemie</a> — pH-balanced leather cleaners that won't strip natural oils, enzyme-based odor eliminators that destroy bacteria rather than masking smells, and UV-blocking protectants formulated for dashboards and trim.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Using the right product on the right surface matters. Leather requires different care than fabric. Vinyl dashboards need different protection than plastic trim. We carry a full range of professional-grade products so every material in your vehicle gets the correct treatment — never a one-size-fits-all spray.
