          Pet hair works itself deep into fabric fibers and wedges into crevices where vacuums can't reach. Regular cleaning might get the loose hair on top, but the embedded strands stay behind. Every time you sit down, more hair works its way out—it feels like the hair never ends.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We bring our pet hair removal service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. Whether you live near Snyder Park or out by Coral Springs, we come to you with specialized tools designed specifically for pet hair extraction.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          About 40% of our Fort Lauderdale clients have pets. Dog hair removal is one of our most requested add-on services, especially from owners who take their dogs to the beach or dog parks like Bark Park or Snyder Park dog area.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Pet hair removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $50 to $100 depending on how much hair we're dealing with.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A car with light pet hair from occasional trips falls on the lower end. Vehicles used regularly for transporting pets—especially long-haired breeds—need more time and effort. If your dog rides in the car daily, expect to be closer to the higher end.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>We use a multi-step process combining rubber brush extraction, crevice tools, commercial vacuuming, and lint roller finishing to completely remove dog and cat hair from car interiors.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Standard vacuuming only gets surface-level hair. The barbed structure of pet hair means it hooks into fabric weave and resists suction. Our rubber brushes generate static that lifts embedded hair out of the fibers, making it possible to vacuum away completely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          This is the same technique used by professional detailers across the country—it works on all fabric types including cloth seats, carpeting, and headliners.

          We don't rush this service. Pet hair removal requires patience and the right technique. Going too fast means leaving hair behind. We work methodically through seats, carpets, door panels, and all the crevices where hair collects.
