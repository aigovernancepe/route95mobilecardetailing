          Pet hair works itself deep into fabric fibers and wedges into crevices where vacuums can't reach. Regular cleaning might get the loose hair on top, but the embedded strands stay behind. Every time you sit down, more hair works its way out—it feels like the hair never ends.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Pet Hair Removal Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Pet hair removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $50 to $100 depending on how much hair we're dealing with.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A car with light pet hair from occasional trips falls on the lower end. Vehicles used regularly for transporting pets—especially long-haired breeds—need more time and effort. If your dog rides in the car daily, expect to be closer to the higher end.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          We can combine pet hair removal with other services like vacuuming or odor treatment for better value.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Pet hair removal takes 30 to 45 minutes for most vehicles, depending on hair volume and how deeply it's embedded.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We don't rush this service. Pet hair removal requires patience and the right technique. Going too fast means leaving hair behind. We work methodically through seats, carpets, door panels, and all the crevices where hair collects.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Is Pet Hair So Hard to Remove?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Pet hair has a barbed structure that grips fabric fibers. Static electricity makes it cling to surfaces. Regular vacuums don't have the suction or attachments to pull embedded hair free.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Florida's dog-friendly lifestyle means lots of pets in cars. We have year-round park weather, dog-friendly beaches, and outdoor cafes that welcome pets. All those trips mean hair buildup.
