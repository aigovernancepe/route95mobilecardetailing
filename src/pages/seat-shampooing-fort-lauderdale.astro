          Your car seats take a beating in South Florida. Between sweat on hot days, sunscreen from beach trips, and spilled drinks, fabric seats absorb it all. Regular vacuuming only removes surface dirt. The oils, stains, and odors trapped deep in the fibers need professional shampooing to come out.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Much Does Seat Shampooing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Seat shampooing in Fort Lauderdale costs $50 to $100 depending on your vehicle size and the condition of your seats.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A standard sedan with light soiling falls on the lower end. Larger vehicles like SUVs or minivans cost more because there are more seats to clean. Heavy staining from coffee spills, pet accidents, or years of buildup may need extra treatment time, which affects the price.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">How Long Does Seat Shampooing Take?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Seat shampooing takes about 45 minutes for most vehicles, with drying time of 2-4 hours depending on humidity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          We work efficiently but never rush. Each seat gets proper attention. The actual cleaning goes quickly, but we spend extra time on extraction. Pulling out as much moisture as possible speeds up drying and prevents that musty smell that can develop in Florida's humidity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          On humid days, we recommend leaving your windows cracked slightly to help seats dry faster.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0f2a4a] mb-4">Why Do Your Car Seats Need Shampooing?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Fabric seats absorb sweat, body oils, and spills that vacuuming alone cannot remove. Shampooing extracts what's trapped deep in the fibers.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          In Fort Lauderdale, your seats face extra challenges. Sunscreen transfers from your skin and leaves oily residue. Sweat soaks in during hot summer months. Sand from beach trips works its way deep into the fabric. Over time, this buildup creates odors and makes seats look dingy even after vacuuming.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Signs your seats need shampooing:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Visible stains from drinks, food, or sunscreen</li>
          <li>Musty or sour smell when you get in the car</li>
          <li>Fabric looks darker or discolored</li>
          <li>You can see the outline where people sit</li>
          <li>Allergies act up when driving</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Coffee and sunscreen are the two most common stains we treat in Fort Lauderdale. Both require pre-treatment for complete removal.
