## H1: Car Wash Fort Lauderdale

Skip the drive-through car wash that leaves swirl marks and water spots. Route95 brings professional hand car wash service directly to your Fort Lauderdale home or office. We use Chemical Guys premium products and proven techniques to protect your paint while delivering a spotless finish.

**Call 754-215-2272 for same-day mobile car wash service in Fort Lauderdale.**

### Why Hand Washing Matters in South Florida

Fort Lauderdale's environment is harsh on vehicles. Salt air from the ocean deposits corrosive residue on your paint daily. The intense Florida sun bakes contaminants into your clear coat. Automatic car washes with spinning brushes grind this debris across your paint, creating fine scratches that dull your finish over time.

Our mobile car wash service eliminates these problems. We hand wash every vehicle using the two-bucket method that professional detailers trust. Fresh microfiber mitts glide across your paint without scratching. And we bring our own purified water to prevent mineral deposits and water spots.

Whether you're in Las Olas Isles, Nurmi Isles, Seven Isles, or anywhere in Broward County, Route95 delivers car wash results that automated washes simply cannot match.

## H2: Hand Wash

Our hand wash service is the foundation of proper car care. We start by rinsing your vehicle to remove loose dirt and debris. Then we use a pH-balanced Chemical Guys soap that lifts grime without stripping wax or sealant protection.

Every panel gets individual attention. We work from top to bottom, rinsing our wash mitt frequently to avoid dragging contaminants across your paint. Door jambs, gas cap areas, and other often-missed spots get cleaned thoroughly.

The result is a truly clean vehicle without the micro-scratches that automatic washes leave behind. Your paint stays smooth and glossy for years longer.

## H2: Car Waxing

Fort Lauderdale sun is brutal on automotive paint. UV rays fade colors and break down clear coats. Car waxing creates a sacrificial barrier that absorbs this damage instead of your paint.

We apply Chemical Guys carnauba wax by hand, working it into the paint for maximum bonding. This protective layer also repels water, making future washes easier and helping your car stay cleaner between details.

For luxury vehicle owners in Las Olas and Nurmi Isles, regular waxing preserves your car's showroom appearance and protects your investment.

## H2: Clay Bar Treatment

Even after washing, your paint may feel rough or gritty. That texture comes from bonded contaminants like industrial fallout, rail dust, tree sap, and overspray that washing alone cannot remove.

Clay bar treatment safely pulls these contaminants from your clear coat. We glide a specially formulated clay across lubricated paint, and it grabs embedded particles without scratching. Your paint feels glass-smooth afterward.

This service is essential before waxing or applying any paint protection. Smooth paint allows protective products to bond properly and last longer.

## H2: Wheel Cleaning

Brake dust is corrosive. Left on your wheels, it etches into the finish and causes permanent damage. Our wheel cleaning service removes brake dust, road grime, and tar before they cause problems.

We use dedicated wheel brushes and pH-balanced cleaners safe for all wheel finishes including chrome, aluminum, and painted wheels. Each spoke and barrel gets scrubbed clean. We also clean behind spokes where brake dust accumulates heaviest.

Clean wheels dramatically improve your car's overall appearance and prevent expensive wheel refinishing down the road.

## H2: Tire Dressing

Nothing finishes a car wash like properly dressed tires. We apply a quality tire dressing that restores the deep black appearance of your rubber without leaving a greasy mess that slings onto your paint.

Our tire dressing also conditions the rubber, helping prevent dry rot and cracking caused by Florida's intense UV exposure. Your tires look great and last longer.

## H2: Chrome Polishing

Salt air near the Intracoastal and Atlantic takes a toll on chrome trim, exhaust tips, and emblems. Chrome polishing removes oxidation, water spots, and light corrosion to restore mirror-like shine.

We use specialized chrome polish and soft cloths to bring back the brilliant finish your trim had when new. Regular chrome polishing prevents pitting and permanent damage from Fort Lauderdale's coastal environment.

## H2: Bug and Tar Removal

Love bug season in South Florida covers your front end with acidic insect remains. Road tar from fresh pavement sticks to lower panels and wheel wells. Both contaminants damage paint if left untreated.

Our bug and tar removal service safely dissolves these stubborn deposits without harming your clear coat. We treat affected areas with specialized chemicals that break down bug proteins and tar adhesives, then gently wipe everything clean.

## H2: Water Spot Removal

Hard water from sprinklers and mineral-heavy rain leaves white spots etched into your paint and glass. These water spots bond to the surface and won't come off with regular washing.

Water spot removal requires specialized compounds that dissolve mineral deposits without scratching. We carefully treat affected areas to restore clarity to your paint and windows. For homes with sprinkler systems in Las Olas or Seven Isles, this service keeps your car looking perfect despite daily water exposure.
