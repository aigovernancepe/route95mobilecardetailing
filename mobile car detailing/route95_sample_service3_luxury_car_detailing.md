## H1: Luxury Car Detailing Fort Lauderdale

Luxury car detailing provides specialized care for high-end vehicles using products and techniques designed specifically for premium materials and finishes.

Route95 specializes in luxury and exotic vehicle detailing throughout Fort Lauderdale. We understand that a Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, or Ferrari requires different care than a standard vehicle. The materials are more delicate. The finishes are more refined. And owner expectations are higher.

Owner Gustavo Moya built Route95 specifically to serve Fort Lauderdale's luxury car community. From the exotic vehicles parked along Las Olas Boulevard to the premium SUVs in Nurmi Isles and Seven Isles driveways, we provide detailing that matches the quality of the vehicles we service.

We use Chemical Guys professional products tested safe for all premium finishes. Every detailer on our team understands the specific requirements of luxury interiors including Nappa leather, alcantara, carbon fiber trim, and delicate wood accents.

## H2: How Much Does Luxury Car Detailing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Luxury car detailing in Fort Lauderdale typically ranges from $300 to $600 or more depending on vehicle size and services needed.

Exotic vehicles like Ferrari, Lamborghini, and McLaren often require additional time and specialized techniques, so pricing reflects that extra care. We provide detailed quotes after understanding exactly what your vehicle needs.

Standard luxury vehicles (Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Porsche) fall in the lower to middle range. Full-size luxury SUVs (Range Rover, Escalade, G-Wagon) cost more due to their size. Exotic sports cars and supercars require the most attention and time.

## H2: What Makes Luxury Car Detailing Different?

Luxury vehicles contain premium materials that require specialized products and techniques regular detailers don't understand or possess.

**Delicate Paint Finishes**
Many luxury vehicles feature soft, single-stage paints or matte finishes that scratch easily and require specific polishing methods. Using wrong products or techniques causes permanent damage.

**Premium Interior Materials**
Nappa leather differs from standard automotive leather. Alcantara (suede-like material) cannot be cleaned like regular fabric. Piano black trim shows every fingerprint and micro-scratch. Carbon fiber requires special care.

**Higher Standards**
Luxury car owners notice details that others miss. A streak on the window. A light swirl in the paint. A fingerprint on the center console. We detail to the standard you expect.
