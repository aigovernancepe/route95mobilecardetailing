## H1: Upholstery Cleaning Fort Lauderdale

We bring professional equipment and Chemical Guys products directly to your location.

**Call 754-215-2272 for same-day mobile upholstery cleaning in Fort Lauderdale.**

### Why Interior Cleaning Matters in South Florida

You spend hours inside your car every week. The air you breathe circulates through carpets, seats, and air vents that trap dust, allergens, and bacteria. Florida humidity accelerates the growth of mold and mildew in these hidden areas.

Sunscreen, sweat, and body oils transfer to your seats every time you drive. Food crumbs fall between seats where they decompose. Sand from Fort Lauderdale Beach works its way into carpet fibers. Over time, your interior becomes a collection of everything that's touched it.

Our upholstery cleaning service removes what you can see and what you can't. We extract embedded dirt from carpets and seats. We sanitize surfaces that harbor bacteria. We eliminate odors at their source instead of covering them up.

Whether you drive to work in downtown Fort Lauderdale or shuttle kids around Nurmi Isles, Route95 keeps your interior fresh, clean, and healthy.

## H2: Seat Shampooing

Fabric seats absorb everything: spilled coffee, sweat, food particles, and everyday dirt. Over time, this buildup creates stains, odors, and a dingy appearance that vacuuming alone cannot fix.

Our seat shampooing service deep cleans fabric upholstery using hot water extraction. We apply a cleaning solution that breaks down embedded grime, then extract it along with the dirt. Your seats dry fresh and clean without residue that attracts new dirt.

For vehicle owners in Las Olas and Seven Isles who demand pristine interiors, regular seat shampooing maintains that new-car feel.

## H2: Carpet Shampooing

Car carpets take constant abuse from shoes tracking in dirt, sand, and moisture. Florida's frequent rain means wet floors that promote mold growth underneath floor mats.

Carpet shampooing extracts deep-seated dirt that vacuuming misses. We lift floor mats and treat the entire carpet area including under seats and in the trunk. Stubborn stains from spills, mud, and mystery spots get individual attention until they're gone.

Your carpets come out clean, fresh, and free from the musty smell that humid conditions create.

## H2: Leather Cleaning

Leather interiors are common in Fort Lauderdale's luxury vehicles. But leather requires specific care that most car owners don't provide. Body oils, sunscreen, and lotions break down leather's protective finish. The result is cracking, discoloration, and premature aging.

Our leather cleaning removes these damaging deposits safely. We use pH-balanced Chemical Guys leather cleaner that lifts grime without stripping natural oils. Every surface gets cleaned including seats, door panels, armrests, and steering wheels.

Clean leather is the essential first step before conditioning. Without proper cleaning, conditioner seals dirt and oils into the leather instead of nourishing it.

## H2: Leather Conditioning

Florida sun bakes through your windows and dries out leather interiors. Without regular conditioning, leather becomes brittle, cracks, and fades. Replacement costs thousands of dollars.

Leather conditioning replenishes the natural oils that keep leather supple and resistant to damage. We apply Chemical Guys leather conditioner that penetrates deep into the material, not just sitting on the surface.

Properly conditioned leather resists UV damage, feels softer, and lasts years longer. For luxury vehicle owners, this simple maintenance protects significant investment in premium interiors.

## H2: Dashboard Cleaning

Your dashboard faces direct sunlight every day. Dust, fingerprints, and UV exposure make it look faded and neglected. Cracks develop in dried-out materials.

Dashboard cleaning removes dust and grime from all surfaces including vents, gauges, and infotainment screens. We use appropriate cleaners for each material type: vinyl, plastic, leather, and electronics.

After cleaning, we apply UV protection that slows sun damage and prevents the cracking that ruins South Florida dashboards.

## H2: Interior Vacuuming

Thorough vacuuming is the foundation of interior cleaning. But our approach goes far beyond a quick once-over with a shop vac.

We remove floor mats and vacuum underneath. We move seats forward and back to reach every inch of carpet. We use crevice tools to extract dirt from between seats, in cup holders, and around controls. We vacuum seat surfaces, door pockets, and trunk areas.

This detailed vacuuming removes loose dirt before we begin any wet cleaning, preventing mud and streaking.

## H2: Steam Cleaning

Steam cleaning sanitizes without chemicals. High-temperature steam kills bacteria, dust mites, and mold on contact. It also loosens stubborn dirt and stains for easy removal.

We use steam cleaning on carpets, seats, and hard surfaces throughout your interior. It's especially effective for sanitizing air vents where bacteria accumulate and circulate through your cabin.

For Fort Lauderdale families concerned about allergens and germs, steam cleaning provides peace of mind that your vehicle interior is truly clean.

## H2: Odor Removal

Odors inside vehicles have many sources: food spills, mold, pets, smoke, and general staleness. Air fresheners only mask these smells temporarily. True odor removal requires eliminating the source.

We identify where odors originate and treat those areas specifically. Ozone treatment neutralizes odor-causing bacteria and molecules throughout the cabin. The result is a genuinely fresh interior, not a perfume-covered problem.

## H2: Smoke Odor Removal

Cigarette and cigar smoke penetrates every surface inside a vehicle. The smell embeds in headliners, seats, carpets, and air conditioning systems. This is one of the most difficult odors to eliminate completely.

Our smoke odor removal process includes deep cleaning all surfaces, treating the air system, and using ozone to neutralize smoke molecules. We've restored interiors that previous owners assumed were permanently damaged by smoke.

## H2: Pet Hair Removal

Fort Lauderdale pet owners know the struggle. Dog and cat hair weaves into carpet fibers and upholstery fabric. Regular vacuuming pulls some out, but most stays stubbornly embedded.

Our pet hair removal uses specialized tools and techniques to extract embedded fur completely. We use rubber brushes, compressed air, and focused vacuuming to pull pet hair from deep in fabrics.

Your back seat will look like your furry friend was never there.

## H2: Interior Protection

After deep cleaning your interior, protection keeps it looking great longer. Interior protection creates barriers that repel stains, UV damage, and everyday wear.

We apply fabric protector to seats and carpets that causes spills to bead up instead of soaking in. Leather gets UV-blocking conditioner. Plastic and vinyl surfaces receive protectant that slows sun damage.

This protection makes future cleaning easier and extends the life of your interior materials.

## H2: Fabric Protection

Fabric seats and carpets are vulnerable to stains. One spilled drink can leave a permanent mark. Fabric protection creates an invisible barrier that prevents liquids from penetrating fibers.

After shampooing your upholstery, we apply fabric protector that bonds to the material. Future spills bead up on the surface where you can wipe them away before staining occurs.

For families with kids or anyone who eats and drinks in their vehicle, fabric protection saves future cleaning costs and preserves your interior appearance.
