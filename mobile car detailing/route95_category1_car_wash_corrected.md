## H1: Car Wash Fort Lauderdale

**Answer Capsule:** Mobile car wash that comes to your Fort Lauderdale home or office. We bring all water and equipment—you don't lift a finger.

We bring professional car washing directly to you anywhere in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Pompano Beach. No need to wait in line or drive across town. Our mobile service arrives at your home, office, or anywhere convenient with everything needed for a thorough exterior clean.

We use Chemical Guys premium wash products in a two-bucket system that safely lifts dirt without scratching your paint. This matters especially for luxury vehicles where swirl marks show easily on dark finishes.

Same-day appointments often available. Call 754-215-2272.

## H2: Hand Wash

Our hand wash uses Chemical Guys Mr. Pink Super Suds in a two-bucket method that prevents scratches. We wash by hand because automated brushes damage paint over time—especially on luxury vehicles like Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche.

## H2: Car Waxing

Wax creates a protective barrier between your paint and Florida's intense sun, salt air, and daily contaminants. We apply Chemical Guys Butter Wet Wax by hand for deep gloss and 4-6 weeks of protection.

## H2: Clay Bar Treatment

Clay bar removes bonded contaminants that washing alone can't touch—industrial fallout, tree sap, overspray, and rail dust. If your paint feels rough after washing, it needs clay bar treatment before waxing.

## H2: Wheel Cleaning

Brake dust is corrosive and bakes onto wheels in Florida heat. We use pH-balanced wheel cleaners safe for all finishes—chrome, polished aluminum, and painted wheels—to remove buildup without damage.

## H2: Tire Dressing

Tire dressing restores the deep black appearance of your sidewalls while protecting rubber from UV cracking. We use water-based dressings that won't sling onto your paint when you drive.

## H2: Chrome Polishing

Salt air in Fort Lauderdale causes chrome to pit and dull over time. We polish chrome trim, exhaust tips, and emblems to restore shine and apply sealant to slow future corrosion.

## H2: Bug and Tar Removal

Love bug season in May and September leaves acidic residue that etches clear coat within 24 hours. We safely dissolve bug splatter and road tar without damaging your paint or wax protection.

## H2: Water Spot Removal

Sprinkler systems and hard water leave mineral deposits that etch into paint if left untreated. We remove water spots and can apply protection to prevent future spotting on vehicles parked near irrigation.
