## H1: Dashboard Cleaning Fort Lauderdale

Professional dashboard cleaning removes dust, grime, and fingerprints while adding UV protection against Florida's intense sun.

Your dashboard takes the worst sun exposure of any interior surface. In Fort Lauderdale, that means year-round UV bombardment that fades color, dries out vinyl, and eventually causes cracking. A dusty dashboard also looks neglected and can trigger allergies when your AC blows particles around the cabin.

We bring our dashboard cleaning service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. Whether you live near the Boatyard neighborhood or out by Plantation, we come to you with professional products that clean and protect in one visit.

Dashboard cleaning includes your entire front dash area—the main surface, instrument cluster, center console, vents, screens, and all the trim pieces that collect dust and fingerprints.

## H2: How Much Does Dashboard Cleaning Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Dashboard cleaning in Fort Lauderdale costs $30 to $50 depending on your vehicle's interior complexity.

Basic interiors with simple dash layouts fall on the lower end. Luxury vehicles with multiple screens, intricate trim pieces, and textured surfaces take more time and care, which affects pricing.

Most clients add dashboard cleaning to other interior services like vacuuming or leather care. We can bundle services for better value.

## H2: How Long Does Dashboard Cleaning Take?

Dashboard cleaning takes about 30 minutes for most vehicles, with protection lasting 4-6 weeks.

We work through each section of your dashboard methodically. Vents need special attention because dust collects deep inside. Screens require gentle cleaning with products that won't leave residue or damage displays. Textured surfaces trap dust and need proper agitation to release it.

Your car is ready to drive immediately after we finish.

## H2: Why Does Your Dashboard Need Professional Cleaning?

Florida sun damages unprotected dashboards faster than anywhere else. UV rays fade color, dry out materials, and cause cracking that ruins your interior.

Dashboards are made from vinyl, plastic, and rubber compounds that break down under UV exposure. Without protection, these materials:

- Fade from black or gray to a chalky lighter color
- Become brittle and develop cracks
- Shrink slightly, causing gaps and squeaks
- Release chemicals that create that "new car smell" film on your windshield

Beyond sun damage, a dirty dashboard affects your driving experience. Dust particles blow through your vents and into your lungs. Grime on screens makes them harder to read. Sticky residue on controls feels unpleasant every time you adjust something.

Signs your dashboard needs attention:
- Visible dust layer on surfaces
- Faded or grayish color on trim pieces
- Fingerprints and smudges on screens
- Sticky feeling on buttons and controls
- Film buildup on inside of windshield

## H2: Our Dashboard Cleaning Process

1. **Dust Removal** — We start with soft brushes to dislodge dust from vents, crevices, and textured surfaces without scratching.

2. **Surface Cleaning** — We apply Chemical Guys Total Interior cleaner to dissolve grime, oils, and sticky residue from all dashboard surfaces.

3. **Detail Work** — Cotton swabs and detailing brushes reach into buttons, vents, and tight areas around screens and controls.

4. **Screen Care** — Touchscreens and instrument clusters get gentle cleaning with products that won't leave streaks or damage displays.

5. **UV Protection** — We apply Chemical Guys Silk Shine protectant for a natural satin finish. This non-greasy formula blocks UV rays without that shiny, artificial look some products create.

For severely faded dashboards, we can apply VRP (Vinyl, Rubber, Plastic) restorer to bring back the original dark color before protecting.
