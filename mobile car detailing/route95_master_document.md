For tough stains like coffee or pet accidents, we pre-treat with Lightning Fast Stain Extractor before shampooing.

### Original Data Opportunities

Add these types of statements (adjust based on actual experience):

**Exterior:**
- "In our experience detailing luxury vehicles in Fort Lauderdale, we've found that wax protection lasts only 4-6 weeks due to intense UV exposure."
- "Most Fort Lauderdale vehicles we detail have water spot damage from sprinkler systems—we recommend monthly maintenance washes."
- "Love bug season (May and September) causes the most paint damage we see—acidic bug remains etch clear coats within 24 hours if not removed."

**Interior - Leather:**
- "We typically use 2-3 coats of Leather Conditioner on Florida vehicles because the sun depletes moisture faster than northern climates."
- "In our experience, leather needs conditioning every 2-3 months in Fort Lauderdale due to intense UV exposure through windows."
- "The driver's seat always shows wear first—body oils from your left arm on the door panel and right hand on the center console accelerate deterioration."

**Interior - Carpet/Upholstery:**
- "Beach sand is the #1 carpet contaminant we see in Fort Lauderdale vehicles—it works deep into fibers and requires professional extraction."
- "Florida humidity means we always extract as much moisture as possible after shampooing to prevent mildew growth."
- "Coffee and sunscreen are the two most common stains we treat in Fort Lauderdale—both require pre-treatment for complete removal."
- "We find that fabric-seated vehicles in Florida benefit from Hydro Thread protection more than anywhere else due to sweat and humidity."

**Pet-Related:**
- "About 40% of our Fort Lauderdale clients have pets—dog hair removal is one of our most requested add-on services."
- "Pet accidents require enzymatic treatment to fully eliminate odors—regular cleaning only masks the smell temporarily."
