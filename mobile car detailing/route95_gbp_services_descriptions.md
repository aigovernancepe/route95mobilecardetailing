## EXTERIOR SERVICES (Car Wash Category) - 8 Services

### 1. Hand Wash
```
Professional hand wash using the two-bucket method and pH-balanced soap. We never use brushes that scratch your paint. Removes dirt, salt spray, and road grime safely. Takes about 30-45 minutes. Great for regular maintenance between full details.
```

### 2. Car Waxing
```
Hand-applied carnauba wax that protects your paint from Florida sun and salt air. Creates a water-repelling barrier that makes washing easier and keeps your car shiny longer. Takes about 45 minutes. Recommended every 2-3 months for daily drivers.
```

### 3. Clay Bar Treatment
```
Removes bonded contaminants like tree sap, industrial fallout, and overspray that washing can't touch. Your paint feels glass-smooth afterward. Essential before waxing or applying any paint protection. Takes about 30-45 minutes.
```

### 4. Wheel Cleaning
```
Deep cleaning of wheels and wheel wells to remove brake dust, road tar, and grime. We clean each spoke and behind the wheel where brake dust builds up most. Safe for all wheel types including chrome, aluminum, and painted. Takes about 20 minutes.
```

### 5. Tire Dressing
```
Restores deep black color to your tires and protects rubber from UV damage and dry rot. We use a non-greasy formula that won't sling onto your paint. Included with most wash packages or available separately. Takes about 10 minutes.
```

### 6. Chrome Polishing
```
Removes oxidation, water spots, and light corrosion from chrome trim, exhaust tips, and emblems. Restores mirror-like shine. Especially important near the ocean where salt air damages chrome quickly. Takes about 20-30 minutes depending on how much chrome your vehicle has.
```

### 7. Bug and Tar Removal
```
Safely dissolves and removes bug splatter, road tar, and tree sap without damaging your clear coat. Important during love bug season or after highway driving. We treat affected areas with specialized chemicals before washing. Takes about 15-20 minutes.
```

### 8. Water Spot Removal
```
Removes mineral deposits and hard water spots from paint and glass. Common problem if you park near sprinklers or have hard water at home. We use specialized compounds that dissolve mineral buildup without scratching. Takes about 30-45 minutes depending on severity.
```

## INTERIOR SERVICES (Upholstery Cleaning Category) - 12 Services

### 9. Seat Shampooing
```
Deep cleans fabric seats using hot water extraction. Removes stains, body oils, and embedded dirt that vacuuming misses. Seats dry within 2-3 hours. Great for cloth interiors that look dingy or have visible stains. Takes about 45 minutes for all seats.
```

### 10. Carpet Shampooing
```
Deep extraction cleaning for floor carpets and mats. Removes ground-in dirt, sand, mud stains, and spills. We lift all mats and clean underneath where dirt hides. Helps eliminate musty smells from Florida humidity. Takes about 30-45 minutes.
```

### 11. Leather Cleaning
```
Removes body oils, sunscreen, lotions, and grime from leather seats and surfaces. Uses pH-balanced cleaner safe for all leather types. Essential first step before conditioning—without cleaning first, you're just sealing in dirt. Takes about 30 minutes.
```

### 12. Leather Conditioning
```
Restores moisture and flexibility to leather that Florida sun dries out. Prevents cracking, fading, and premature aging. We use conditioner that absorbs into the leather, not just sits on top. Recommended every 2-3 months for Florida vehicles. Takes about 20 minutes.
```

### 13. Dashboard Cleaning
```
Cleans and protects dashboard, center console, door panels, and all interior trim. Removes dust, fingerprints, and UV damage. We use appropriate products for each material type including screens and electronics. Includes air vent cleaning. Takes about 30 minutes.
```

### 14. Interior Vacuuming
```
Thorough vacuuming of all interior surfaces including seats, carpets, trunk, and crevices between seats. We move seats forward and back to reach everywhere. Uses professional-grade equipment that pulls out sand and debris home vacuums miss. Takes about 20-30 minutes.
```

### 15. Steam Cleaning
```
High-temperature steam sanitizes surfaces and kills bacteria, dust mites, and mold without chemicals. Loosens stubborn dirt and stains for easy removal. Great for air vents, cup holders, and crevices. Recommended for allergy sufferers or if you want true sanitization. Takes about 45 minutes.
```

### 16. Odor Removal
```
Eliminates bad smells at the source instead of masking them with air freshener. We identify where odors come from and treat those areas. Works on food smells, mildew, pet odors, and mystery smells you can't identify. Results are permanent. Takes 1-2 hours depending on severity.
```

### 17. Smoke Odor Removal
```
Specialized treatment for cigarette, cigar, or smoke damage. Includes deep cleaning all surfaces plus ozone treatment that neutralizes smoke molecules embedded in headliner, seats, and air system. One of the toughest odors to remove—we get it done. Takes 3-4 hours.
```

### 18. Pet Hair Removal
```
Extracts embedded pet fur from carpets, seats, and floor mats using specialized tools. Regular vacuums can't pull out fur that's worked into fabric fibers. We use rubber brushes, compressed air, and focused techniques to get every strand. Takes about 30-45 minutes.
```

### 19. Interior Protection
```
Applies protective coating to interior surfaces after cleaning. Fabric gets stain repellent. Leather gets UV-blocking conditioner. Plastic and vinyl get protectant that slows sun damage. Makes future cleaning easier and extends life of your interior. Takes about 30 minutes.
```

### 20. Fabric Protection
```
Spray-on protectant for cloth seats and carpets that causes spills to bead up instead of soaking in. Gives you time to wipe up spills before they stain. Lasts 6-12 months. Highly recommended if you have kids, eat in your car, or want to protect resale value. Takes about 15 minutes.
```

Clear protective film applied to high-impact areas like front bumper, hood, and mirrors. Shields your paint from rock chips, bug damage, and minor scratches. Self-healing technology means light scratches disappear with heat. Popular with luxury car owners who want to preserve factory paint.

Fixes foggy, yellowed, or hazy headlights that reduce visibility at night. We wet-sand the oxidized layer, polish it clear, and apply UV protection to prevent future yellowing. Results last 2-3 years. Much cheaper than replacing headlights. Takes about 45 minutes for both lights.
