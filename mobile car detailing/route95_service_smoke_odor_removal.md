## H1: Smoke Odor Removal Fort Lauderdale

Professional smoke odor removal eliminates cigarette and cigar smell from your car's interior using deep cleaning and ozone treatment.

Smoke odor is one of the hardest smells to remove from a vehicle. Smoke particles are tiny and penetrate everything—seats, carpets, headliner, door panels, vents, and even hard plastic surfaces. Air fresheners can't touch it. You need a systematic approach that treats every surface where smoke has settled.

We bring our smoke odor removal service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From the Landings to Wilton Manors, we come to you with the equipment and expertise to eliminate smoke smell completely.

Getting smoke smell out matters for resale value. Florida has one of the largest used car markets in the country, and non-smoking vehicles sell faster and for more money.

## H2: How Much Does Smoke Odor Removal Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Smoke odor removal in Fort Lauderdale costs $200 to $400 depending on how heavily the car was smoked in.

A car with light smoke exposure—occasional smoking over a few months—falls on the lower end. Vehicles smoked in daily for years need more intensive treatment with multiple ozone sessions. The headliner often holds the most smoke residue and may need special attention.

We'll assess your situation and give you an honest estimate of what it will take.

## H2: How Long Does Smoke Odor Removal Take?

Smoke odor removal takes 3 to 4 hours for a full treatment, sometimes longer for heavy smoke damage.

This is not a quick service. Properly removing smoke smell requires cleaning every surface, running ozone treatment, and sometimes repeating the process. Rushing leads to the smell coming back, so we take the time to do it right.

Your car needs to air out for 20-30 minutes after ozone treatment before driving.

## H2: Why Is Smoke Smell So Hard to Remove?

Smoke particles are microscopic and coat every surface in your car. The smell hides in fabric fibers, foam padding, ventilation ducts, and porous materials throughout the cabin.

When someone smokes in a car, several things happen:

- **Fabric absorption** — Seats, carpets, and headliner absorb smoke deep into their fibers. The smell releases slowly over time.
- **Surface coating** — A thin film of tar and nicotine coats hard surfaces like the dashboard, windows, and trim.
- **Vent contamination** — Smoke circulates through your AC system and coats the evaporator and ducts. Every time you run the AC, it blows that smell back out.
- **Foam penetration** — Seat cushions and padding absorb smoke that regular cleaning can't reach.

This is why air fresheners fail. They add a scent on top of the smoke smell, but the smoke particles are still there, continuously releasing odor.

Signs you need professional smoke odor removal:
- Cigarette smell despite cleaning attempts
- Yellow-brown film on windows
- Burn marks on seats or trim
- Smoky smell when AC runs
- You're preparing to sell the vehicle

## H2: Our Smoke Odor Removal Process

1. **Interior Cleaning** — We deep clean all fabric surfaces including seats, carpets, and headliner. This removes surface smoke residue.

2. **Hard Surface Degreasing** — Dashboard, door panels, console, and all trim get cleaned to remove the tar and nicotine film.

3. **Window Cleaning** — Inside glass gets special attention to remove the yellow smoke film.

4. **Vent Treatment** — We clean inside air vents and treat the AC system where smoke particles accumulate.

5. **Ozone Treatment** — We seal the car and run an ozone generator for 1-2 hours. Ozone molecules bond with smoke particles and neutralize them at a molecular level.

6. **Air Out and Assess** — After treatment, we open the car to air out and check for remaining odor. Heavy smoke cases may need a second ozone session.

Smoke odor removal is one of the few services where we may need to see your car before quoting. The treatment required varies significantly based on smoke exposure level.
