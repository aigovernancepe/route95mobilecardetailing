### Professional Detailing for Discerning Owners

Fort Lauderdale is home to some of the finest vehicles on the road. From the exotic cars parked along Las Olas Boulevard to the luxury SUVs in Nurmi Isles driveways, these vehicles deserve care that matches their quality.

Route95 specializes in premium and high-end vehicles. We understand that a Porsche requires different care than a daily driver. The materials, finishes, and owner expectations demand expertise and attention that generic car washes cannot provide.

Owner Gustavo Moya built Route95 around one principle: every vehicle gets the care it deserves. We use Chemical Guys professional products, proper techniques, and take the time needed to achieve perfect results.

Our mobile service means your luxury car never sits in a parking lot waiting for attention. We come to your home in Seven Isles, your office downtown, or wherever your schedule requires.

## H2: Luxury Car Detailing

High-end vehicles require specialized knowledge and products. Exotic paint finishes, alcantara headliners, fine leather, and carbon fiber trim all need specific care techniques.

Our luxury car detailing service caters to:
- European luxury (Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Porsche)
- Exotic sports cars (Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren)
- Premium SUVs (Range Rover, Escalade, G-Wagon)
- Classic and collector vehicles

We understand the value these vehicles represent. Every product we use is tested safe for delicate finishes. Every technique protects rather than damages premium materials.

Fort Lauderdale's luxury car community trusts Route95 because we treat their vehicles with the respect they deserve.

## H2: Engine Bay Cleaning

Most owners never look under the hood except when something breaks. But a clean engine bay makes maintenance easier, helps spot leaks early, and significantly increases resale value.

Engine bay cleaning removes built-up grease, dirt, and grime from engine surfaces. We protect sensitive electronics, then carefully degrease and detail every visible component. Hoses, covers, and the firewall all get attention.

The result is an engine compartment that looks as cared-for as the rest of your vehicle. It's especially impressive when selling a car or attending a car show.

## H2: Paint Protection Film

Fort Lauderdale roads throw rocks, debris, and sand at your paint daily. Highway driving behind trucks is especially damaging. Paint protection film creates an invisible shield that absorbs this damage.

This clear, self-healing film applies to high-impact areas like the front bumper, hood, fenders, and mirrors. When debris strikes the film instead of your paint, it protects your finish completely. Minor scratches in the film actually heal themselves with heat from the sun.

For luxury and exotic car owners, paint protection film preserves the factory finish that determines resale value. The investment pays for itself by preventing expensive paint repairs.

## H2: Headlight Restoration

Foggy, yellowed headlights reduce your visibility at night and make your car look older than it is. Florida sun degrades the plastic lens coating faster than anywhere else in the country, causing this hazy appearance within just a few years.

Headlight restoration removes the oxidized layer and restores crystal clarity. We wet-sand the damaged surface with progressively finer grits, polish it smooth, and apply UV protection to prevent future yellowing. Your headlights look new and function safely again.

This service costs a fraction of headlight replacement and delivers the same clear result. Most restorations complete in about 45 minutes for both headlights.

## H2: Trim Restoration

Black plastic trim fades to gray under Florida sun. Door handles, mirror caps, window surrounds, and bumper trim all suffer from UV exposure. This aged appearance makes even a clean car look neglected.

Trim restoration brings back the original deep black color and provides UV protection to slow future fading. We treat all exterior plastic trim so the restored color contrasts beautifully against your paint, making your whole vehicle look newer instantly.

For luxury vehicles where appearance matters most, trim restoration is one of the highest-impact services we offer. The difference is immediately visible.
