### COMPARISON: OLD vs NEW STYLE

**❌ Generic (Old Style):**
> "Route95 Mobile Car Detailing LLC is a professional car detailing service serving the Fort Lauderdale area. We offer interior and exterior detailing, paint protection, and more. Contact us today for a quote."

**✅ Conversational (Gemini-Optimized):**
> "We bring professional car detailing directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Pompano Beach. Same-day appointments often available—just call and we can usually be there today..."

**The difference:** Gemini can parse the new version and match it to natural voice queries. The old version lacks specificity and context.
