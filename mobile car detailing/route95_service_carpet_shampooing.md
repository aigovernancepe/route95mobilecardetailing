## H1: Carpet Shampooing Fort Lauderdale

Professional carpet shampooing removes ground-in dirt, sand, and stains from your car's floor using deep extraction cleaning.

Your car's carpets catch everything that comes in on your shoes. In Fort Lauderdale, that means beach sand, mud from afternoon rain showers, and dirt from parking lots. Over time, this debris works deep into the carpet fibers where vacuuming can't reach it.

We bring our carpet shampooing service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From the waterfront homes in Nurmi Isles to condos near downtown, we come to you with all our equipment and water. No need to drop your car off anywhere.

Professional carpet cleaning does more than make your floors look better. It removes the trapped moisture and organic matter that can lead to mold growth in Florida's humid climate.

## H2: How Much Does Car Carpet Shampooing Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Car carpet shampooing in Fort Lauderdale costs $40 to $80 depending on your vehicle size and carpet condition.

Compact cars and sedans with light soiling fall on the lower end. SUVs, trucks, and minivans have more floor space and cost more to clean. Heavy staining from mud, spills, or years of neglect may need multiple passes and pre-treatment, which adds to the price.

We always give you an exact quote before starting. Just describe what you're dealing with and we'll tell you what to expect.

## H2: How Long Does Carpet Shampooing Take?

Carpet shampooing takes 30 to 45 minutes for most vehicles, plus 2-4 hours of drying time afterward.

We remove your floor mats and clean them separately. The main carpet gets shampooed in sections so we don't oversaturate any area. We spend extra time on extraction because pulling out moisture is the key to preventing mildew in Florida's humidity.

Leaving windows cracked after we finish helps carpets dry faster, especially on humid days.

## H2: Why Do Your Car Carpets Need Shampooing?

Car carpets trap sand, dirt, and moisture that vacuuming alone cannot remove. Shampooing extracts contaminants from deep in the fibers.

Beach sand is the number one carpet problem we see in Fort Lauderdale vehicles. Sand particles are sharp and work their way deep into carpet fibers. Each time you step on the carpet, those particles grind against the fibers and cause wear. Professional extraction pulls out what vacuuming leaves behind.

Florida's humidity makes carpet care even more important. Moisture from wet shoes, spilled drinks, or rain getting in creates perfect conditions for mold and mildew. That musty smell many cars develop comes from organic matter breaking down in damp carpet.

Signs your carpets need shampooing:
- Visible stains from drinks, food, or mud
- Gritty feeling even after vacuuming
- Musty or sour smell in your car
- Discoloration or dark patches
- Allergies act up when driving

## H2: Our Carpet Shampooing Process

1. **Floor Mat Removal** — We take out all mats and clean them separately so we can reach the carpet underneath.

2. **Deep Vacuuming** — Heavy-duty vacuum extraction removes loose sand and debris before we add any liquid.

3. **Pre-Treatment** — Stains get treated with Chemical Guys Lightning Fast Stain Extractor. This enzyme formula breaks down coffee, food, and pet accidents.

4. **Shampooing** — We apply Chemical Guys Foaming Citrus Fabric Clean and agitate with stiff brushes to lift embedded dirt from carpet fibers.

5. **Hot Water Extraction** — Our extractor injects hot water and immediately vacuums it out, pulling dissolved dirt from deep in the carpet pile.

6. **Maximum Extraction** — We make multiple passes to remove as much moisture as possible. This prevents mildew and speeds up drying.

Want to protect your carpets after cleaning? Ask about Hydro Thread ceramic fabric coating. It creates a barrier that makes spills bead up instead of soaking in.
