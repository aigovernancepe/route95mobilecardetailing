## H1: Upholstery Cleaning Fort Lauderdale

**Answer Capsule:** Mobile interior cleaning that comes to your Fort Lauderdale location. We deep clean seats, carpets, leather, and remove odors on-site.

Florida's humidity, sand, and sun take a toll on your vehicle's interior. Sweat soaks into fabric seats, leather dries and cracks, and mildew grows in damp carpet fibers. We bring professional interior cleaning directly to your home or office in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Pompano Beach.

We use Chemical Guys interior products designed for each surface type—pH-balanced leather cleaners, oxygen-infused fabric shampoos, and enzymatic odor eliminators. Our extraction equipment removes deep-set dirt and moisture that causes mildew in humid climates.

Same-day appointments often available. Call 754-215-2272.

## H2: Seat Shampooing

We deep clean fabric seats using Chemical Guys Foaming Citrus Fabric Clean, an oxygen-infused shampoo that penetrates fibers to lift embedded dirt, sweat, and stains. Hot water extraction pulls out contaminants and excess moisture.

## H2: Carpet Shampooing

Beach sand works deep into carpet fibers where vacuuming can't reach. We shampoo and extract carpets to remove sand, salt, dirt, and stains. Proper extraction prevents mildew growth in Florida's humidity.

## H2: Leather Cleaning

Leather collects body oils, sunscreen, and dirt that break down the finish over time. We use pH-balanced Chemical Guys Leather Cleaner with a horse hair brush to lift grime from leather pores without damage.

## H2: Leather Conditioning

Florida sun through windows dries leather and causes cracking. We apply Chemical Guys Leather Conditioner with Vitamin E and aloe to restore moisture and flexibility. Most Fort Lauderdale vehicles need conditioning every 2-3 months.

## H2: Dashboard Cleaning

Dashboards collect dust, UV damage, and greasy film from air conditioning. We clean all interior plastics and apply UV protectant to prevent fading and cracking from intense Florida sun exposure.

## H2: Interior Vacuuming

Thorough vacuuming reaches under seats, in crevices, and between cushions where dirt hides. We use commercial equipment with crevice tools to remove sand, crumbs, pet hair, and debris from every corner.

## H2: Steam Cleaning

Steam sanitizes and deep cleans without harsh chemicals. High-temperature steam kills bacteria, loosens grime, and refreshes fabrics. Safe for all interior surfaces including sensitive leather and electronics.

## H2: Odor Removal

Odors from food, mildew, and spills absorb into fabric and carpet padding. We use enzymatic treatments that break down odor-causing bacteria at the source rather than masking smells with fragrance.

## H2: Smoke Odor Removal

Cigarette and cigar smoke penetrates every porous surface—headliner, seats, carpet, and air vents. We use ozone treatment combined with deep cleaning to eliminate smoke odor, not just cover it up.

## H2: Pet Hair Removal

Pet hair weaves into fabric fibers and resists normal vacuuming. We use specialized tools and techniques to extract embedded pet hair from seats, carpets, and tight spaces. About 40% of our Fort Lauderdale clients request this service.

## H2: Interior Protection

After cleaning, we apply protectants to all interior surfaces—UV blockers for plastics, fabric sealant for seats, and leather conditioner for hides. Protection extends the life of your interior and makes future cleaning easier.

## H2: Fabric Protection

Chemical Guys Hydro Thread creates an invisible ceramic barrier on fabric seats and carpets. Spills bead up on the surface instead of soaking in, giving you time to wipe up before stains set.
