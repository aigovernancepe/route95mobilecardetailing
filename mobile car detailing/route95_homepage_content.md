## H1: Mobile Car Detailing Fort Lauderdale

Fort Lauderdale's sun, salt air, and humidity can be tough on your car. That's why Route95 Mobile Car Detailing brings professional car care right to your driveway, office, or wherever you are in Broward County. We specialize in luxury and high-end vehicles, using Chemical Guys products to deliver showroom results every time.

**Call us today at 754-215-2272 for same-day mobile car detailing in Fort Lauderdale.**

### Why Fort Lauderdale Car Owners Choose Route95

Living in South Florida means your car faces daily challenges. The intense sun fades paint and cracks dashboards. Salt air from the Atlantic corrodes chrome and trim. Afternoon rain leaves water spots that etch into clear coats. And the humidity? It creates the perfect environment for mold and mildew inside your vehicle.

We understand these local conditions because we detail cars here every day. From the luxury homes in Las Olas Isles to the waterfront properties in Nurmi Isles and Seven Isles, we've seen what the Florida climate does to vehicles. That's why our mobile car detailing service is built specifically for Fort Lauderdale car owners who demand the best.

Owner Gustavo Moya started Route95 with a simple idea: bring professional detailing to where you are. No more waiting at a shop. No more rearranging your schedule. Whether you're enjoying brunch near Las Olas Boulevard, having dinner at Daniel's Steakhouse, or working from your home in the Boatyard neighborhood, we come to you and transform your vehicle while you go about your day.

### What Makes Our Mobile Service Different

Most car washes rush through dozens of vehicles per hour. They use harsh chemicals and recycled water. The result? Swirl marks, missed spots, and a "clean" that lasts maybe two days.

Route95 takes a different approach. We treat every vehicle like it's our own. Each mobile car detailing appointment gets our full attention. We bring all our own water, power, and premium Chemical Guys products. Your car gets a complete detail without you lifting a finger.

**Our satisfaction guarantee means you'll love the results or we make it right.**

## H2: Car Wash

A proper car wash does more than make your vehicle look good. It protects your investment from Fort Lauderdale's harsh elements.

Our mobile car wash service starts with a thorough hand wash using pH-balanced Chemical Guys soap. We never use automated brushes that scratch your paint. Every panel gets individual attention from our trained detailers.

South Florida roads are covered in bugs, especially during love bug season. We handle bug and tar removal carefully so these contaminants don't damage your clear coat. The salt air near the Intracoastal leaves residue that we eliminate during every wash.

For vehicles that need extra care, we offer clay bar treatment. This process removes bonded contaminants that washing alone can't touch. Your paint feels glass-smooth afterward, ready for wax or sealant protection.

**Our car wash services include:**

- Hand wash with premium soap
- Wheel cleaning and tire dressing
- Clay bar treatment for contaminated paint
- Bug and tar removal
- Water spot removal
- Chrome polishing
- Car waxing for lasting protection

Living near the water in Las Olas Isles or Nurmi Isles means constant exposure to salt spray. Our hand wash service removes these corrosive deposits before they cause permanent damage. We pay special attention to wheels, trim, and chrome where salt damage shows first.

After washing, we apply tire dressing to keep your rubber looking new. We polish chrome accents to a mirror shine. These details make the difference between a car that looks washed and one that looks professionally detailed.

## H2: Upholstery Cleaning

The inside of your car takes a beating in Fort Lauderdale's climate. Humidity breeds bacteria and odors. The sun bakes dashboards and leather. Sand from the beach gets everywhere.

Route95's interior detailing brings your cabin back to showroom condition. We start with a complete interior vacuuming to remove loose dirt, sand, and debris. Our high-powered equipment reaches under seats and into every crevice where dirt hides.

**Our upholstery cleaning services include:**

- Seat shampooing for fabric interiors
- Carpet shampooing and stain removal
- Leather cleaning to remove body oils and grime
- Leather conditioning to prevent cracking
- Dashboard cleaning and UV protection
- Steam cleaning for deep sanitization
- Pet hair removal
- Interior protection coating
- Fabric protection against future stains

Fort Lauderdale pet owners love our pet hair removal service. We use specialized tools to extract embedded fur from carpets and upholstery. Your back seat looks like your dog was never there.

Do you have kids? We've seen it all. Juice spills, melted crayons, ground-in Cheerios. Our carpet shampooing and steam cleaning eliminate these messes completely.

For leather interiors, we follow a two-step process. First, leather cleaning removes the oils, sunscreen, and grime that accumulate with daily use. Then leather conditioning restores moisture and creates a barrier against UV damage. This prevents the cracking and fading that Florida sun causes.

Smoke odor is one of the toughest problems we solve. Our odor removal process doesn't just mask smells. We eliminate odor-causing bacteria at the source. Whether it's cigarette smoke, mildew from a water leak, or that mystery smell you can't identify, we get rid of it.

## H2: Car Detailing Services

Beyond washing and interior cleaning, Route95 offers specialized car detailing services that protect and enhance your vehicle for the long term.

Our luxury car detailing service caters to high-end vehicle owners throughout Fort Lauderdale. We understand that a Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, or exotic car requires specialized care. The materials, finishes, and attention to detail these vehicles demand is exactly what we provide.

**Our car detailing services include:**

- Full detail packages (interior + exterior)
- Express detail for quick refreshes
- Luxury car detailing for high-end vehicles
- Engine bay cleaning
- Paint protection film installation
- Mobile detailing at your location
- Headlight restoration for foggy or yellowed lenses
- Trim restoration for faded plastic

Headlight restoration is one of our most requested services. Florida's intense UV rays turn clear headlight lenses yellow and hazy over time. This reduces your visibility at night and makes your car look older than it is. We wet-sand, polish, and seal your headlights to restore crystal clarity—for a fraction of the cost of replacement.

Trim restoration brings faded gray plastic back to deep black. The Florida sun bleaches exterior trim within a few years. We restore and protect these surfaces so your car looks newer instantly.

Engine bay cleaning is a service most car owners overlook. But a clean engine bay makes maintenance easier, helps you spot leaks early, and adds value when selling your vehicle. We degrease and detail your engine compartment so it looks as good as the rest of your car.

For maximum paint protection, we offer paint protection film. This clear film shields your paint from rock chips, bug damage, and minor scratches. It's especially popular with luxury car owners who want to preserve their vehicle's finish.

Our express detail is perfect when you need a quick refresh before an event or meeting. In about an hour, we wash the exterior, clean the interior, and have you looking sharp. It's ideal for busy professionals in Fort Lauderdale who want to maintain their vehicle between full details.
