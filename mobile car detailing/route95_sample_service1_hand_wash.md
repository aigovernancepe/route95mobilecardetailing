## H1: Hand Wash Fort Lauderdale

Professional hand washing removes dirt safely without scratching your paint, unlike automated car washes that damage clear coats over time.

Route95 brings mobile hand wash service directly to your Fort Lauderdale home or office. We use the two-bucket method trusted by professional detailers worldwide, combined with pH-balanced Chemical Guys soap that lifts grime without stripping your existing wax protection.

Automatic car washes might be convenient, but those spinning brushes collect dirt and drag it across your paint hundreds of times. The result is swirl marks and micro-scratches that dull your finish. Our hand wash process treats your vehicle the way it deserves to be treated.

We serve all of Fort Lauderdale including Las Olas, Nurmi Isles, Seven Isles, and surrounding Broward County areas. Same-day appointments are often available.

## H2: How Much Does a Hand Wash Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

A professional mobile hand wash in Fort Lauderdale typically costs between $30 and $50 depending on your vehicle size.

Sedans and coupes fall at the lower end of that range. SUVs, trucks, and larger vehicles cost a bit more due to additional surface area. We provide exact pricing when you call based on your specific vehicle.

The investment pays off when you consider the cost of paint correction to remove swirl marks from automated washes. One trip through a tunnel wash can cause damage that costs hundreds to fix.

## H2: How Long Does a Hand Wash Take?

A complete hand wash takes approximately 30 to 45 minutes depending on vehicle size and how dirty it is.

We don't rush through the process like automated washes that cycle cars through in minutes. Each panel gets individual attention. We wash from top to bottom, rinse our mitts frequently, and ensure no dirt gets dragged across your paint.

Since we come to you, this time doesn't cost you anything. Work from home, relax inside, or run errands nearby while we transform your vehicle.

## H2: Why Choose Hand Washing Over Automated Car Washes?

Hand washing is the only safe method to clean your vehicle without causing paint damage from brushes and recycled water.

Here's what happens at automated car washes:

- Spinning brushes collect dirt and debris from previous vehicles
- That grit gets dragged across your paint, creating fine scratches
- Recycled water contains contaminants that deposit on your surface
- Harsh detergents strip wax and dry out rubber seals

Our hand wash process eliminates all these problems. Fresh microfiber mitts glide gently across your paint. Clean water rinses away contaminants. pH-balanced soap cleans without stripping protection.

For luxury vehicle owners in Fort Lauderdale, hand washing isn't optional. It's the only responsible way to maintain your investment.

## H2: Our Hand Wash Process

**Step 1: Pre-Rinse**
We thoroughly rinse your vehicle to remove loose dirt, sand, and debris before any contact washing.

**Step 2: Two-Bucket Wash**
One bucket holds clean soapy water. The second bucket is for rinsing our wash mitt. This prevents reintroducing dirt to your paint.

**Step 3: Panel-by-Panel Cleaning**
We wash one section at a time, working from top to bottom. Each panel gets fresh soap solution.

**Step 4: Rinse and Dry**
A complete rinse removes all soap. We hand dry with clean microfiber towels to prevent water spots.

**Step 5: Final Inspection**
We check every panel for missed spots, water spots, or areas needing extra attention.
