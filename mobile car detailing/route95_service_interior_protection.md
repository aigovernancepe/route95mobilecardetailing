## H1: Interior Protection Fort Lauderdale

Professional interior protection applies UV-blocking coatings to your car's leather, fabric, vinyl, and plastic surfaces to prevent sun damage.

Fort Lauderdale sun destroys car interiors. Leather cracks, fabric fades, dashboards warp, and plastic trim turns gray. These problems happen faster here than almost anywhere else because of our intense year-round UV exposure.

We bring our interior protection service directly to your home or office anywhere in Fort Lauderdale. From homes in Harbor Beach to apartments near downtown, we come to you with professional-grade protectants that block UV rays and make your interior easier to clean.

Interior protection is the difference between an interior that lasts and one that looks worn out in a few years.

## H2: How Much Does Interior Protection Cost in Fort Lauderdale?

Interior protection in Fort Lauderdale costs $75 to $150 depending on your vehicle size and which surfaces you want protected.

Basic protection covers seats and dashboard—the surfaces that take the most sun exposure. Full interior protection adds door panels, rear seats, cargo area, and all trim pieces. Larger vehicles with more surface area cost more.

We recommend full protection for maximum benefit, but we can work within your budget.

## H2: How Long Does Interior Protection Take?

Interior protection takes about 30 minutes for most vehicles, with products fully cured within 24 hours.

Application is quick because the products we use are designed for efficient coverage. Each surface gets the appropriate protectant applied and worked in. Your car is ready to drive immediately—just avoid getting the treated surfaces wet for a few hours while products cure.

Protection typically lasts 4-6 months depending on sun exposure and use.

## H2: Why Does Your Interior Need Protection in Fort Lauderdale?

Florida's UV index regularly hits extreme levels. Without protection, sun damage accumulates daily and causes permanent deterioration.

Every surface in your interior reacts differently to sun exposure:

- **Leather** — UV rays dry out natural oils, causing stiffness and eventually cracking. Protected leather stays supple.
- **Fabric** — Colors fade from sun bleaching. Protected fabric maintains its original appearance longer.
- **Dashboard and trim** — Vinyl and plastic become brittle, fade to gray, and develop cracks. Protection keeps them looking new.
- **Rubber seals** — Sun exposure causes drying and cracking around windows and doors.

We find that fabric-seated vehicles in Florida benefit from protection more than anywhere else due to sweat and humidity. Protection creates a barrier that makes spills and moisture easier to clean up before they cause stains.

Signs your interior needs protection:
- Leather feels dry or stiff
- Dashboard looks faded or chalky
- Fabric colors appear washed out
- Plastic trim has turned gray
- You've never applied interior protection

## H2: Our Interior Protection Process

1. **Surface Cleaning** — Protection products work best on clean surfaces. We make sure everything is free of dirt and residue.

2. **Leather Protection** — We apply Chemical Guys Leather Conditioner with UV blockers to all leather surfaces. This restores moisture while creating a protective barrier.

3. **Fabric Protection** — Seats, carpets, and headliner get treated with Hydro Thread ceramic fabric coating. This creates a hydrophobic barrier that makes liquids bead up instead of soaking in.

4. **Dashboard and Trim** — We apply Silk Shine protectant for a natural, non-greasy satin finish. This formula blocks UV rays without that artificial shiny look.

5. **Plastic Restoration** — Faded trim pieces get treated with VRP (Vinyl, Rubber, Plastic) to restore color and add UV protection.

6. **Final Inspection** — We check all surfaces for even coverage and address any missed spots.

Interior protection works best as part of regular maintenance. We recommend reapplying every 4-6 months to maintain maximum protection against Florida's intense sun.
